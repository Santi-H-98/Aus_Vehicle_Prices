# Aus_Vehicle_Prices

This project is a Kaggle competition. From a dataset with sell car information, to build a model that be able to predict the price of the vehicles.

The model will work to understand how is the behavior of the car prices depending many factors, like year, kilometers, brand, etc. 

In this project I applied concepts about Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Machine Learning.

The libraries used were: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ScikitLearn, XGBoost and TensorFlow.
